This example is taken from

Schauss, T., Peer, A., Buss, M. (2017)
Parameter-Space Stability Analysis of LTI Time-Delay Systems with Parametric Uncertainties
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control.

where some of the results calculated here are presented.

The system and parameters were taken from

Ackermann, J., & Blue, P. (2002).
Robust Control: The Parameter Space Approach.
Springer.

where the delay-free case was used as one of the main examples. Then, one or two delays were
added to the system.

The different examples may be run using the following scripts:
* `run.sh`: Examples without time delay. In contrast to the results in Ackermann2002 this
  includes parameterizations where we map stability to the two-dimensional parameter space
  while to other paramters are intervals.
* `run_td.sh`: Examples with one time delay.
* `run_2td.sh`: Examples with two incommensurate time delays.
* `run_delta_01: Examples with no time delay and a specified minimum damping (not applicable
  to the case with delays and program option `-s1`.
