Thomas Haag, Ulrich Münz, Frank Allgöwer:
Comparison of Different Stability Conditions for Linear Time-Delay
Systems with Incommensurate Delays, 2009

These are time-delay systems without parametric uncertainties
(except for the delay) given by 

dx = A0*x(t) + \sum_{k=1}^N A_k*x(t-\tau_k)

The problem solved in that publication was to find the maximum
admissible delay \bar{\tau} so that all \tau_k < \bar{\tau}.

For all the problems with two delays (4-8) we instead search
for stable regions in the 2d delay space. 
For example 9 with three delays we solve the same problem as in
Haag2009, i.e., we determine the maximum \tau for all delays.

Notes:
* Example one represents a special case which is marginally stable
  due to a root touching the imaginary axis for a delay-value of
  pi (the root is left of the imaginary axis for delays around pi).
  Stability can only be examined in this case if we shift the
  stability boundary slightly to the left half-plane which results
  in some stability robustness. This is done here by a value of
  epsilon.
* The same is done for example two (although it is not necessary
  for that example). This evaluates the location of the right-most
  root with respect to the time delay.
* For all cases the option `--tm_order 3` is set to limit the
  maximum order of the Taylor Model to three. In these cases this
  results in a faster evaluation.
* Mapping the stability boundaries to the delay space is much
  faster than evaluating stability of disjoint regions for most
  examples given here. Call `run_boundary_only.sh` to only map
  the imaginary axis to the parameter space and not check stability
  of disjoint regions. Note, that this is also what is done in the
  publication from which these examples are taken.
