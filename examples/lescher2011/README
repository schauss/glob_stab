These examples were taken from

Fabien Lescher and Clement Roos:
Robust stability of time-delay systems with structured uncertainties:
a mu-analysis based algorithm
CDC-ECC, 2011

and are systems of the form

dx = A0*x(t) + \sum_{k=1}^N A_k*x(t-\tau_k)

the problem solved in the reference was: find maximum delay \tau so
that system is stable for all delta_i=[-1,1].

* Example 1:
  For this example we determine stability in the delta-tau plane for
  different ranges of delay and different resolutions. Interestingly,
  the system is also stable for delays around 8 seconds for delta
  close to -1.
* Example 2:
  In this cases we determine the admissible time delay for different
  ranges of delay. Then, we determine the admissible delay depending
  on the maximum magnitude of all delta_i using the inputs
