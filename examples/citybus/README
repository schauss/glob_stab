The delay-free version of this example is given in

which in turn took it from

Ackermann, J., & Blue, P. (1993).

Springer.

The transfer functions for plant and controller are taken from Hussek2008. A delay is then
added to the feedback-path and the overall transfer function is determined using the
Python-script husek2008_citybus.py.

We then evaluate stability for different delays in the environment plane. As a final step
we determine stability in the delay-velocity plane where the bus-mass is within a given
interval! This evaluation takes very long (~2.5 h on an Intel Core2Duo P8400@2.26GHz)!
However, I am not aware of any other method which could solve this problem
non-conservatively and rigorously at all!

Notes:
* The transfer function depends on the uncertain parameters polynomially in this case!
* I obtain different transfer functions if I determine them based on the
  "Parameter-Space" book (I only have the 2002 version of the book and there may have been
  some changes).
