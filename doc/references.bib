abstract = {A detailed comparison between Taylor model methods and other tools for validated computations is provided. Basic elements of the Taylormodel (TM)methods are reviewed, beginningwith the arithmetic for elementary operations and intrinsic functions. We discuss some of the fundamental properties, including high approximation order and the ability to control the dependency problem, and pointers to many of the more advanced TM tools are provided. Aspects of the current imple- mentation, and in particular the issue of floating point error control, are discussed. For the purpose of providing range enclosures, we compare with modern versions of centered forms and mean value forms, as well as the direct computation of remainder bounds by high-order interval auto- matic differentiation and show the advantages of the TM methods. We also compare with the so-called boundary arithmetic (BA) of Lanford, Eckmann,Wittwer, Koch et al., which was developed to prove existence of fixed points in several comparatively small systems, and the ultra-arithmetic (UA) developed by Kaucher, Miranker et al. which was developed for the treatment of single variable ODEs and boundary value problems as well as implicit equations. Both of these are not Taylor methods and do not provide high-order enclosures, and they do not support intrinsics and advanced tools for range bounding and ODE integration. A summary of the comparison of the various methods including a table as well as an extensive list of references to relevant papers are given.},

@article{Zettler1998,
abstract = {This paper considers the robust stability verification of polynomials with coefficients depending polynomially on parameters varying in given intervals. Two algorithms are presented, both rely on the expansion of a multivariate polynomial into Bernstein polynomials. The first one is an improvement of the so-called Bernstein algorithm and checks the Hurwitz determinant for positivity over the parameter set. The second one is based on the analysis of the value set of the family of polynomials and profits from the convex hull property of the Bernstein polynomials. Numerical results to real-world control problems are presented showing the efficiency of both algorithms},
