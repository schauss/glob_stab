Parameter-Space Stability Analysis of LTI Time-Delay Systems with Parametric Uncertainties

We will add the source code of a stability analysis method based on Taylor Models and
Bernstein polynomials and applicable to time-delay systems with parametric uncertainties
here as soon as the paper presenting the approach has been accepted.
